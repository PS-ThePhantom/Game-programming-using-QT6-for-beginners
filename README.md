# Tutorial

All the work being done on this project is presented in two ways
1: By using QT designer to make GUI's (easy and fast, most things are taken care of)
2: By creating GUI's manually (harder and slow, but you will learn more)

#NOTE
Everything in the two irectories is exactly the same except that on one we
are using QT designer and the other on we are not, but it doesnt affect the 
application functionality or look in anyway

#BEGIN
Choose one folder you'd like to learn qt6 with, there will be a pdf book specific
to the approach and a folder containing project files we created, GOOD LUCK!!!
And Happy programming
