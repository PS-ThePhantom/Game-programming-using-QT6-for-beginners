#QT6 Game Programming Tutorial
Welcome to my QT6 game programming bginners guide.

#QT6 Installation
for QT6 IDE installion open up "QT6 Installation.pdf" to get
in depth step by step installation guide, after you are done
or you already have it installed on your dvelopment machine,
you can start by choosing the project you would like to start
with, but we recommend starting with the first 1 "Tic-Tac-Toe"
to get familiar with how we present it and what we expect from
you as many small things are presentd there and not repeated
elsewhere, you can continue in the specific order to increase
your knowledge of QT.

#Before You Start
We assume you have basic and sufficient knowledge of c++ when
you beging with this course, if you don't, its best to get
familiar with it as we will be using it, also if you don't
understand a c++ concept you may encounter, its best to pause
and search more about it before you continue.

#Good Luck!!!
We hope you enjoy this course as just much as we enjoy presenting
it to you.
